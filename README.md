Ulku and Kiryl Module 3 Project

**INTRODUCTION**
In this project, we will review Module 3 and run statistical tests on Pitchfork Reviews data.

**DATASET:** https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data

**OBJECTIVES**
To use knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be meaningful to the company/stakeholder.

**STRUCTURE**

**Test 1:** One Sample T-Test

    Question: _Is there a difference between the ratings of ROCK music and all other music genres?_
    Conclusion: _Because t-statistics is less than t-critical, i.e. is located to the left of t-critical value with alpha = 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that rock music in general rated lower._

**Test 2:** Two Sample T-Test

    Question: _Is there a statistical difference between the average ratings of jazz music and metal music genres?_
    Conclusion: _Because t-statistics is less than t-critical, i.e. is located to the left of t-critical value with alpha = 0.05 level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that jazz and metal music average ratings are statistically different._

**Test 3:** One-Factor ANOVA Test

    Question: _Is there a significant effect of publication day on content length?_
    Conclusion: _Based on test results, we reject a null-hypothesis and conclude that with 5% level of confidence, review publication day effects content length._

**Test 4:** Chi-Squared Test

    Question: _Is there any difference in distributions of ratings in past 2 years?_
    Conclusion: _Conclusion:
Based on test results, we reject a null-hypothesis and conclude that at 5% level of confidence there is a sufficient evidence of changing in distribution of genres reviewed in that magazine  in the last two years
_

**SUMMARY** 

During this project we reveiwed given dataset, formulated questions and hypotheses, run statistical test.
